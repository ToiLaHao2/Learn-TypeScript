What is TypeScript?
    TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

    This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

    => TypeScript allows developers to add TYPES.

Why should we use TypeScript?
    TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.
    This helps in catching errors early in the development process, reducing bugs and improving code quality.

How do we use TypeScript?
    A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

    Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!

    Extension of VSC that developers can use to program with TypeScript: ESLint, Prettier or Prettier ESLint, Code Spell Checker, Path Intellisense,
    Auto Rename Tag, Better comments, TypeScript importer, TypeScript toolbox, DotENV, Quokka.js

    TypeScript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that JavaScript runs!

Steps to install the compiler

    2. Install TypeScript
        2.1. Open terminal
        2.2. npm install -g typescript
